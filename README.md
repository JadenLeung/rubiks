virtual-cube.net is a passion project of mine that allows you to learn and practice your cubing skills virtually. I used [Antoine Gaubert’s cube](https://github.com/angauber/p5-js-rubik-s-cube) for the basic animation, but coded my own mouse and keyboard movements to support many features it doesn’t have. It's filled with a variety of cubes, fun game modes, customizability settings, solve analysis, and more!

<h1>Base features</h1>

<img width=50% alt="image" src="https://github.com/JadenLeung/rubiks/assets/94010935/99048330-a74c-477f-9c61-b66abe8959f0">

You can input an algorithm into the algorithm bar and the cube will perform it.
The Auto-Solve feature is my best attempt and making the cube solve using the CFOP method. You can adjust the turn speed to make it solve faster or slower.
Use the undo and redo buttons in case you misturn. <br>

<h1>Cube settings</h1>
<img width=50% alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc260d1-87d0-4e21-ae44-40e86666fca1"> <br>
You can change the cube settings to make the cube hollow, change the background color, change the size of the cube, and more!


<h1>Turning</h1>

The keyboard and button turning works with any cube. You can select between the default keyboard (which has the CS Timer keybinding) and a more beginner-friendly alternative keyboard. 
The mouse turning works on any non-shape/color mod.
For keyboard turning, you can give yourself restrictions, such as double turns only or making the cube turn like a 3x3x2. You can give yourself similar restrictions with the scrambling, such as making it only scramble the last layer.
Press Settings to see all the keyboard hotkeys.

<h1>Cube Variety</h1>
<h3>Pre-made Cubes</h3>

Choose from 25+ cubes with different colors, dimensions, and bandages!



<h3>Custom Bandage/Shape Mod</h3>

<p><i>Creating a custom bandage</i></p>
</div>


Design your own cube! <br>
The colors, dimensions, bandages, and shown cubies can be adjusted. <br>
For the custom bandaging, you can even create bandage cubies that usually cannot be physically bandaged. For example, you can bandage 2 corners together.

<h1>Stats Mode</h1>
See, analyze, and delete your times.

<h1>Speed Mode</h1>

<h3>Time Attack</h3>
<img width=30% alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dae759d4-33aa-4dfa-8565-440d1f068c28">

You are given 4 challenges, and your time is the sum of the times it takes to complete the 4 challenges. There are 4 attack modes: Easy, Medium, OLL, and PLL. 
Selecting a 2x2 or 3x3 will result in different challenges.

<h3>OLL/PLL Practice</h3>
<div>
  <img width=30% alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c90e66b-628a-4c70-9bf3-09be87619296" />

</div>

Select the OLLs, PLLs, and PBLs you want to practice. The website even gives you the recommended algorithm.

<h3>Bot Racing</h3>
Race the auto-solve bot with your own physical cube! You can adjust the speed of the bot as well.



<h1>Challenge Mode</h1>

<h3>Fewest Moves Challenge</h3>
<img width="30% alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ee5ad51-8a11-4353-893e-5a076aae0d00" /> <br>
Given a short scramble, you must figure out an efficient way to solve it. You have 3 lives, so use your hints wisely.
<h3>Marathons</h3>
Solve 8 cubes in the shortest amount of time! Select from a Shape mod marathon or a Bandage mod marathon.
<h3>Blind Challenge</h3>
How many "peeks" do you need to solve a 3x3? A 2x2? The entire shape mod collection? Give a hand at your memorization abilities.

<h1>Weekly Challenges</h1>

Daily scamble: Each day you have one attempt to solve a 2x2 and a 3x3.
Weekly scramble: Everyone has the same scramble for a week. So how fast you can cut down that scramble!

<h1>Position ID</h1>

Every valid 3x3 position is marked with an text-based ID. You can copy the ID and save it somewhere in case you want to get back the same position.

<h3>Webcam ID Generator</h3>
<img width=30% alt="image" src="https://github.com/JadenLeung/rubiks/assets/94010935/2269c74e-9593-490e-95ff-2274608f1313"> <br>
Use the ID generator to generate an ID for your **real cube**. The program will use the webcam to calibrate the colors and then take a picture of all the faces to generate it. If the camera incorrectly detected a color, you can press the detected color to manually adjust it.

<h3>Paint ID Generator</h3>
<img width=30% alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bc0d771-5221-4bef-8f67-c2dcdb60a9f9" /> <br>
Paint the cube how you want it! I recommend using the hotkeys ("r" for red, etc.) to make this faster.


<h3>Solve your physical cube</h3>

Use any ID generator to generate the corresponding position in the virtual cube and follow the Auto-Solver’s steps. You might want to add a bit of delay to make it easy to follow.

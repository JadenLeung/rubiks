Introducing…virtual-cube.net!

virtual-cube.net is a passion project of mine that allows you to learn and practice your cubing skills virtually. I used Antoine Gaubert’s cube for the basic animation, but coded my own mouse and keyboard movements to support many features it doesn’t have. You can choose cubes of a variety of shapes: the traditional 2x2 and 3x3, as well as other cubes like the Sandwich Cube and bandaged cubes. You can use the Auto-Solver to solve any positions, input and test other algorithms, set turning/scrambling restrictions to challenge yourself, and analyze your own solve. It can also scan your physical 3x3 and transpose its position to the virtual cube.


Base features
You can input an algorithm into the algorithm bar and the cube will perform it.
The Auto-Solve feature is my best attempt and making the cube solve using the CFOP method. You can adjust the turn speed to make it solve faster or slower.
There are undo and redo buttons in case you misturn

Turning
The keyboard and button turning works with any cube. You can select between the default keyboard (which has the CS Timer keybinding) and a more beginner-friendly alternative keyboard. 
The mouse turning works on any non-shape/color mod.
For keyboard turning, you can give yourself restrictions, such as double turns only or making the cube turn like a 3x3x2. You can give yourself similar restrictions with the scrambling, such as making it only scramble the last layer.
Press Settings to see all the keyboard hotkeys.

Custom Bandage/Shape Mod: found by pressing “Other” for the cube
For the custom shape, you can adjust the color of a side and the appearance of a cuby.
For the custom bandaging, you can even create bandage cubies that usually cannot be physically bandaged. For example, you can bandage 2 corners together.

Stats Mode
See, analyze, and delete your times.

Speed Mode
You are given 4 challenges, and your time is the sum of the times it takes to complete the 4 challenges. This is a good way to practice OLL/PLL.
Bot Racing: Race against the Auto-Solver with your own physical cube! You can adjust how fast the Auto-Solver solves, and it simulates a race.

Fewest Moves Challenge
Given a short scramble, you must figure out an efficient way to solve it.

Position ID
Every valid position is marked with an text-based ID. You can copy the ID and save it somewhere in case you want to get back the same position.
ID generator: Use this to generate an ID for your real cube. The program will use the webcam to calibrate the colors and then take a picture of all the faces to generate it. If the camera incorrectly detected a color, you can press the detected color to manually adjust it.
You can even fool it to generate impossible positions! 
You can technically use this to solve your own cube if you don’t know how to do it. Generate the corresponding position in the virtual cube and follow the Auto-Solver’s steps. You might want to add a bit of delay to make it easy to follow

I made this cube because I wanted to an easy way to practice cubing online. Hope you find this fun/useful!
